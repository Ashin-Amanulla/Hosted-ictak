            For every course of ours, we set the initial expectations through appropriate orientation to the programme.
            The entry is assessed and baselined to ensure people with the right prerequisites are absorbed into our
            training programme. Participants are provided with access to a digital library through the course contents
            for the enrolled courses are mapped into the digital learning contents to enable self-paced learning.
            However, the digital learning contents are a collection of a large source of content on various skills that
            the participants can use to learn self-paced content on various future skills and digital skills
            programmes.<br>
            As part of the synchronous learning process, participants are guided through live learning, instructor-led,
            video content and Q&A sessions. The third channel of learning is through a collaborative platform, which
            acts as an interactive platform where the learners and instructors are connected 24x7. This platform also
            enables peer-to-peer learning.<br>
            The other channel of learning is through Self-learning, where participants are required to submit
            assignments, solve problems through mini-projects and attend intermediate formative assessments.
            Participants get an opportunity to connect with industry experts to understand the real-time implementation
            of the skills learnt. Participants get to also solve industry problems through Virtual Internships. As part
            of the exit, participants are progressively evaluated through formative and summative assessments.
